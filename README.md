# Test Project - Finding keywords
## Overview
This test project is to generate keywords for a systematic review search. The code is based on the R Package Litsearchr.
It is based on initially performing a naive search for articles and then followingly applying a

The previous code has been rewritten into functions for easier general reproduction.
